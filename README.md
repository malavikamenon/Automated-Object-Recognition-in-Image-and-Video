# Automated-Object-Recognition-in-Image-and-Videos
In the rapidly evolving field of computer vision, detecting and recognizing objects within images is crucial for a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to security systems. Traditional methods of object detection require extensive manual intervention and are often prone to inaccuracies, especially in complex or real-time environments. The challenge is to develop an automated, efficient, and accurate object detection system that can process and analyze images in real-time with minimal human input, leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision techniques.
